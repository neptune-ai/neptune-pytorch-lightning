# Neptune + PyTorch Lightning Integration

Experiment tracking, model registry, data versioning, and live model monitoring for PyTorch Lightning trained models.

## What will you get with this integration? 

* Log, display, organize, and compare ML experiments in a single place
* Version, store, manage, and query trained models, and model building metadata
* Record and monitor model training, evaluation, or production runs live

## What will be logged to Neptune?

* monitor model training live,
* log training, validation, and testing metrics, and visualize them in the Neptune UI,
* log hyperparameters,
* monitor hardware usage,
* log any additional metrics,
* log performance charts and images,
* save model checkpoints,
* do whatever you would expect from a modern ML metadata store.
